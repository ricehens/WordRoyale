# WordRoyale

Imagine GamePigeon Word Hunt, but:
* Grid size (and timer) can be customized!
* You can play with others live on the same board!
* You can form teams to compete live on the same board!

The jar release should work out-of-the-box over LAN. You can probably play remotely via port forwarding or something.
